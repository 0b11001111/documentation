   Journal

     A journal is like a folder in which you record all transactions
     of the same type: all the statements of a bank account, all
     customer invoices, all supplier bills. Itâ€™s used to organize
     similar transactions together.

   Payment Terms

     Payment terms describe how and when a customer invoice (or
     supplier bill) should be pay over the time. Example: 30% direct
     payment, balance in two months.

   Bank Reconciliation

     Bank reconciliation is the process of matching your payment lines
     with existing journal items or creating new journal items on the
     fly.

   Reconciliation

     Journal items reconciliation is the process of linking several
     journal items together like an invoice and a payment. This allows
     to mark invoices as paid.

   Deposit Ticket

     Deposit tickets group several payment orders (usually checks)
     that are deposited together at the bank. This allows an easy
     reconciliation with the bank statement line if the line has one
     line per deposit.
