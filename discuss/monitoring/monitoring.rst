Use the **inbox** to monitor updates and progress on everything you do
in Odoo. Notifications from everything you follow and conversations in
which you are mentioned appear in your inbox.

Marking an item with a check sets the message to **read** and removes it
from your inbox. If you would like to save an item for future reference
or action, mark it with a star to add it to the **Starred** box. You can
star any message or notification in Discuss or any of the item-specific
chatters throughout Odoo to keep tabs on it here.

Sending Emails
==============

You can **send emails** from the inbox of Odoo Discuss. In addition
to the usual email features, you can select a template that you have
already created, or create one on the fly and save it for later use.
