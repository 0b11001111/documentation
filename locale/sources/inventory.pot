msgstr ""

#: ../../inventory/delivery/dropshipping.rst:8
msgid "Drop-Shipping is a system that allows orders taken from your store to be shipped straight from your supplier to your customer. On a usual delivery system, products are sent from your supplier to your warehouse to be put in stock, and then shipped to your customers after ordering. With drop-shipping, no item is stocked. When a customer places an order in your shop, the item is delivered straight from the supplier to the customer. Therefore, the product doesn't need to get through your warehouse."

msgid "Points to be considered while implementing drop-shipping"
msgstr ""

#: ../../inventory/delivery/dropshipping.rst:20
msgid "Use drop-shipping only for the products you can't or don't want to keep in stock. One reason is that you'll always make smaller margins on items that are drop-shipped, so you should keep it only for items that take up a lot of space in your warehouse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../inventory/delivery/dropshipping.rst:25
msgid "Drop-shipping is best for niche products. Chances are that products that are in high demand are being offered by large suppliers at a fraction of the price you'll be able to charge, so using a more costly shipping method won't be financially rewarding.
